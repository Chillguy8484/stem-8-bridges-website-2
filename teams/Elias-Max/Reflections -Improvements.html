                Our bridge only held 1 pound, this is because each spaghetti beam was only one piece of spaghetti, rather than 2 or 3.
            </p>
            <p>
                Even though, we got second place in the contest. The reason for this is because our bridge was SUPER light, it was 26 grams, so our score multiplier is off the charts.

                Now, we are going to make our spaghetti beams thicker, with 3-4 sticks per beam.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our bridge is going to be a bit heavier, and much taller.

                For this bridge we used 3 sticks for most beams, and 4 sticks for a few. But doing this used up our glue really fast.

                 Well, we need to ration or glue better. We can choose better amounts of sticks, or make the sticks shorter.
