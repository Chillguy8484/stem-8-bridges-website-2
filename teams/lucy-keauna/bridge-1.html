<h3> Design process </h3>
    It was a very narrow bridge.

<div>  Measurements: </div> 
 <div>  -length: 60cm </div>
   <div> -hight: 20cm</div> 
    
    <div> -width: 5cm </div> 
      <div>
    Our thoughts were that if we had a thin bridge we would have leftover spagetti for extra support. </div>
</div>
<div>For the next test we have lots of new ideas and strategies to make test #2 better than the last.</h5></div>

<div><h3> Problem</h3></div>
<span style="background-color: #ffff00">-Off balance / too tippy</span> <div> </div>
<span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> -Not wide enough </span>
 <div> <h3> Results </h3></div>
Sadly our bridge broke while we were finishing it up on the day of the crushing.

<div> <h3>Reflections and improvement </h3></div>
<h3>We have defenitly learnt that wide bridges are better than narrow.</h3>
<div> Making sure the top is leveled </div>
 <div> Most of all we will try to avoid getting disqualifyed </div>
