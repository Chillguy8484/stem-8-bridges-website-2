<h3> Design process </h3>
    It was a very narrow bridge.

<div>  <h4> Measurments</h4> </div> 
        <h4> -length: 60cm </h4>
        <div> <h4> -hight: 20cm </h4></div> 
    
    <div> <h4>-width: 5cm</h4> </div> 
      <div> <h4>
          Our thoughts were that if we had a thin bridge we would have leftover spagetti for extra support.  

For the next test we have lots of new ideas and strategies to make test #2 better than the last. </h4></div>

<div><h3> Problem</h3></div>
<span style="background-color: #ffff00">-Off balance / too tippy</span> <div> </div>
<span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> -Not wide enough </span>
 <div> <h3> Results </h3></div>
Sadly our bridge broke while we were finishing it up on the day of the crushing.

<div> <h3>Reflections and improvement </h3></div>
<h3>We have defenitly learnt that wide bridges are better than narrow.</h3>
<div> Making sure the top is leveled </div>
 <div> Most of all we will try to avoid getting disqualifyed </div>
