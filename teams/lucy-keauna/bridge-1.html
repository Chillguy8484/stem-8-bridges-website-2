    <h1> First Bridge </h1>
    
</div>
</div>
<h3> Design process </h3>
<div>
    -A thin bridge </div>
  <div>  -thin = more sturdy 
</div>
<h5> Measurements 

<div>
    -length: 60cm </div>
   <div> -hight: 20cm</div> 
    
   <div> -width: 5cm </div> 
    <div>  </div>
    Our thoughts were that if we had a thin bridge we would have leftover spagettii for extra support. </div>

<div> For the next test we have lots of new ideas and strategies to make test #2 better than the last.<//div></h5> </div>

<div><h3> Problem</h3></div>
<div> - Off balance / too tippy </div>
<div> - Not thick enough</div>
