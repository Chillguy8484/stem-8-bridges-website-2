Design process

Our design was a thin bridge that was (measurements width length hight)
</div>
    <div>
    Our thoughts were that if we had a thin bridge we would have leftover spagettii to make the bridge thicker and sturdy
    Our bridge was not good because it was too thin which made it tippy and when trying to stand it up it would tilt.

for the next test we have lots of new ideas and strategies to make test #2 better than the last.
