        What are we doing?

         <p>
          We are making bridges out of spaghetti, and learning how they toppled over and what we can do to fix that.

    The first bridge we built was a truss bridge, it contained 5 sections with triangles facing outwards on both sides. Each sections is 5cm long in length. 
        In total the bridge is 60cm long and the top is 50cm long, with a heigth of roughly 7cm and a width of 10cm. The total weight of our bridge is 150g.
        Our bridge held 4 pounds because the end of our bridge snaped which lead to us getting 12.1 points.

        Our 2nd bridge is 58cm it is around 10cm tall and 10cm wide.
        It has two levels to promote stability and all of the squares are crossbraced with triangles.
        Again this bridge is a truss bridge because we found that these bridges are quite succesful.
        Some of the spaghetti that are in ares of higher stress are more reinforced that the others.
