    The first bridge we built was a truss bridge, it contain 5 sections with tringles facing outwards on both sides. Each sections is 5cm long in length 
        In total the bridge is 60cm long and the top is 50cm long, with a heigth of rougthly 7cm long and a width of 10cm. The total weight is 150g.
        Our bridge held 4pounds because the end of our bridge snap which lead us gettin 12.1 points
